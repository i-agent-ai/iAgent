# Fix DocumentUpload Issues

## Overview
Fix two critical issues with the DocumentUpload functionality:
1. Prevent automatic tab switching after file upload
2. Enable proper multiple file upload with correct progress tracking

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Automatic Tab Switching
- **Problem**: After upload completion, DocumentManagementDialog automatically switches to "manage" tab
- **Location**: `DocumentManagementDialog.tsx` - `handleUploadComplete` function
- **Fix**: Remove or make optional the automatic tab switching behavior

### Issue 2: Multiple File Upload Problems  
- **Problem**: Only first file uploads when multiple files are dropped
- **Root Cause**: File ID tracking mismatch between upload logic and UI controls
- **Location**: `DocumentUpload.tsx` - file ID generation vs. usage in cancel/remove functions

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix Automatic Tab Switching
- Modify `DocumentManagementDialog.tsx` to remove automatic tab switching
- Keep upload completion callback but don't force navigation
- Allow user to manually navigate to see uploaded files

### 2. Fix Multiple File Upload System
- Fix file ID tracking in `DocumentUpload.tsx`
- Ensure cancel/remove functions use correct file IDs  
- Improve upload progress display and cleanup behavior
- Implement proper file cleanup after 1 second delay for completed uploads

### 3. Enhance Upload UX
- Show 100% completion for successful uploads
- Auto-remove successfully uploaded files after 1 second
- Maintain proper error handling and file size/count limits
- Ensure all UI controls work correctly with multiple files

## Key Files to Modify
- `apps/frontend/src/components/DocumentManagementDialog.tsx`
- `apps/frontend/src/components/DocumentUpload.tsx`

## Success Criteria
- Multiple files can be uploaded simultaneously
- No automatic tab switching after uploads
- Files show 100% completion then disappear after 1 second
- All existing validation (max files, max size) still works
- Cancel and remove buttons work correctly for all files

### To-dos

- [ ] Remove automatic tab switching in DocumentManagementDialog after file upload
- [ ] Fix file ID tracking system in DocumentUpload for multiple files
- [ ] Implement proper upload completion behavior with 1-second auto-cleanup
- [ ] Test multiple file upload functionality and validation limits
